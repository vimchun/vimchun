## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my profile. 

My name is **Minh**, I am currently transitioning into **data engineering** 🛠️ and actively seeking entry-level roles in the **Île‑de‑France region** (Greater Paris area).

Here is my main project: 🔗 **[Job Market in France](https://github.com/vimchun/Job-Market-in-France)**

- This project delivers a full end-to-end data pipeline that analyzes the French tech & data job market, from API-based job offer ingestion to visual dashboards and operational monitoring.

- ⚙️ Key Components:

  - **Containerised** the full solution using **Docker Compose** (PostgreSQL, Airflow, FastAPI, Prometheus, Grafana)
  - **Orchestrated** ETL workflows using **Apache Airflow 3.0** (ingested live job offers via REST API, performed data transformations and loaded the results into PostgreSQL)
  - **Built** a REST API with **FastAPI** 
  - **Created** interactive **Power BI dashboards**
  - **Monitored** metrics with **Prometheus**, and **visualised** insights with **Grafana dashboards**
